Approach to solving challenge
======

- Use user stories to write the first set of feature tests (which should fail). 
- Write a series of unit tests based on the client's requirements to ensure that all feature tests pass. 
- Refactor the code and ensure it conforms to the Travis style guide and SRP. 
- Submit a pull request.
